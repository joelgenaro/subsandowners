      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      First lets understand an important concept how we use tokens to understand
      more about cookies. Normally what we do is when a user makes an api call
      to backend, we need a way to authenticate the user accessing the data is
      authenticated. For this to happen the hashed cookie is decrypted and then
      the id is checked if it is present in the db. Now we all know that db
      calls are expensive and what if there was a way to check if the id is of
      an authenticated user before we make further db queries. Interesting
      right.
